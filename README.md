# RNN-TV-Script-Generator
In this project, we will generate our own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using recurrent neural networks (RNNs).  We will use a part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  The RNN model will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

This project is a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.
